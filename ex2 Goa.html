             which rise to nearly 4,000 feet (1,220 metres) on the eastern edge of the state. The two largest rivers are the Mandavi and the Zuvari, between the mouths of which lies the island of Goa (Ilhas). The island is triangular, 
            the apex (called the cape) being a rocky headland separating the harbour of Goa into two anchorages.
